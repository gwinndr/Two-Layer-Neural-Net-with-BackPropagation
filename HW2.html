<h2><font color="gray">How Simple Is Your Net?</font></h2>

<hr>

Consider the following training set (gzipped) on 1000 dimensions:
<a href="http://afsweb.clarkson.edu/class/cs241/train-a2-449.txt.gz">training set</a>.

<p>

Design a Boolean classifier (outputs +1/-1) which is fully accurate on the training set.
This means that the total number of misclassifications that the classifier makes on the
training set should be zero. Use a classifier that is a neural network with one output
and some hidden units.

</p><p>

Then run your classifier on this testing set (gzipped): 
<a href="http://afsweb.clarkson.edu/class/cs241/test-a2-449.txt.gz">testing set</a>.
Report the number of misclassifications of your classifier on the testing set.

<h3>What to submit</h3>

Collect the Boolean predictions of your classifier on the testing set in a single text file
(as a sequence of +1 and -1 separated by spaces in a single line). 
Also store your net as a text file using the following format.
The first line should be an integer that represents the number of hidden units.
The second line should be the sequence of weights used by the output units.
The subsequent lines should be the sequence of weights used by each hidden unit
on the inputs (ordered in the same manner as the data). So, if you use M hidden units,
this file should have M+2 lines. The last M+1 lines should have 1000 entries in them.

Submit via email the two text files along with your source code for the homework.
